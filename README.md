#Oregon election 2016

To move away from binary thinking, plots of election results by county can help display the diversity of voting across the state.  In addition, making plots of eligible voters and/or population per county helps avoid confusing geographic area with number of voters.

Currently missing data:

>1. Demographics by county  
>2. Senator election results  

Currently missing plots of interest:

>1. Somehow combining election results with population to show weighted results
